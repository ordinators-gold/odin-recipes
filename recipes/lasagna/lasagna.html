    <p> Lasagna Noodles/Cheese Topping:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2.5 cups of mozarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prep Work:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the Cheese Filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure the remaining ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make the Meat Sauce:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat olive oil </strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions.</strong> Let them soften for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. 
            Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it's fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes. 
            <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Dran excess grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong> and use a silicon spatula to "clean" the bottom and sides of the pot.
        <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and worcestershire sauce.</strong>Bring to a boil,
                then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>                
    </ol>
    <p>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>375°F</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid
        boil is reached, <strong>cook the noodles al dente</strong> according to package instructions.
        (set a timer to ensure you don't overcook them). Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to
        prevent the noodles from sticking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water</strong> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Assemble:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of of meat sauce </strong>on the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Next, 
        <strong>add 4 lasagna noodles, </strong>overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture </strong>over the noodles, followed by about 
        <strong>1 1/2 cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Top with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Finish with <strong> 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, </strong> and 
        <strong>the rest of the meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Top with 2 1/2 cups of mozarella cheese.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spray foil with non-stick cooking spray </strong> and plaice it 
        spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Bake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes.</strong> <em>Remove cover</em> and <strong>bake for 10 more minutes</strong></li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <strong>Let it for 15 minutes prior to serving</strong>
        to allow the layers set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
